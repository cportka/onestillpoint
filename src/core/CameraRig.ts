/**
 * The camera is purely an input device. OrbitControls drives a real
 * PerspectiveCamera — swipe / drag to orbit, pinch / scroll to dolly — and each
 * frame we read its world position and orthonormal basis into the uniform bus,
 * where the raymarch shader uses them to build a view ray per pixel.
 *
 * It also serves as the formation intro's `IntroDriver`: the sequence dollies
 * the camera along the home ray (controls disabled) and hands back on arrival.
 *
 * Distances are in units of M (gravitational radii); the horizon sits at 2M, so
 * minDistance keeps the camera comfortably outside it. See build plan §5 / §7.
