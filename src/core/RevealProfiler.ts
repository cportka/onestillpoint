/**
 * Reveal profiler — captures the **cold first-load reveal**'s real timings so the
 * splash→engine hitch (roadmap #1) can be *measured*, not guessed.
 *
 * Why it has to live in the app at all: this project's CI GPU is headless
 * (swiftshader) — it renders black and the WebGPU canvas can't be captured by any
 * method — so the reveal's frame-times only exist on a real device. This exposes
 * them at `osp.perf`: open the console on the target Mac/phone after a cold load
 * and read `osp.perf.report()` (the loop also logs it once the first-frames window
 * fills), or compare two URL-param'd builds on the same device.
 *
 * It is **pure** — the caller passes timestamps (`performance.now()`) and absolute
 * frame times, so it unit-tests with no DOM/GPU and no clock of its own. Two kinds
 * of signal:
 *   - **marks** — named span durations (renderer init, shader compile, boot→loop,
 *     loop→reveal), via `begin`/`end` or `record`.
 *   - **frames** — the *true, unclamped* inter-frame interval over the first N live
 *     frames (`tick`). Inter-frame interval is the smoothness signal: a frame the
 *     GPU can't finish in one vsync stretches the interval, so a hitch reads as a
 *     long interval (and a jank). We measure it here rather than reusing the loop's
 *     `frameDelta`, which is clamped to 100 ms (`Loop.ts`) and would hide the worst
 *     hitches — exactly the ones we care about.
