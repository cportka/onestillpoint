  //      target** via createRenderPipelineAsync — the RT's color format is part of the pipeline
  //      cache key, so compiling against the default framebuffer (the old call) warmed the WRONG
  //      variant and the real one compiled synchronously in the GPU process at first submit;
  //   2. two covered post renders prime the bloom/FXAA quad pipelines (no async API exists for
  //      those in three r184) with the *lit* disk (formation forced to 1 — the shader multiplies
  //      disk density by it, so priming at 0 would skip the whole volume path);
  //   3. `onSubmittedWorkDone` then *actually drains* that queued GPU work — the old awaited rAF
  //      resolved while ~2s of sync pipeline compiles were still queued (the swap chain lets the
  //      CPU run ahead), so the debt landed on the first live frames and froze every rAF on the
