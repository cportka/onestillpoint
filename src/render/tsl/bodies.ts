/**
 * Intensity (0..1) of the **torn-stream arc** at a point `p`: a tube of gas swept along the body's
 * orbital **circle**, starting at the body and **trailing behind** it (opposite its velocity) by an
 * arc that grows with `tear`, wrapping the hole and spiralling gently outward — so the rip follows
 * the event-horizon circle instead of spiking radially. `vel` is the body's velocity (its orbit
 * tangent); `squash` thins the tube. A cheap point test — use it at a segment midpoint.
 *
 * Geometry: in the body's orbital plane (normal `n = center × vel`), `p` has an azimuth measured
 * from the body; we clamp that azimuth to the trailing arc `[0, tear·MAX_ARC]` (the clamp gives
 * rounded end-caps), find the point on the (gently spiralling) circle there, and shade by distance
 * to it. At `tear = 0` the arc is a single point → a plain sphere at the body.
