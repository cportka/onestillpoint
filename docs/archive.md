# Archive — historical findings (compressed)

A short digest of point-in-time docs that have served their purpose. The actionable
findings all shipped (see the [CHANGELOG](../CHANGELOG.md)) and the durable ones are
baked into the code; this file keeps the *conclusions* in one place so the old
per-version files (`video-findings-v0.14.4/5.md`, `perf-audit-v0.15.md`,
`intro-description.md`) could be removed without losing the why.

## Physics / N-body (perf audit, v0.15 + v0.15.1)

- **The CPU integrator is the default, on purpose.** The GPU compute path forces a
  per-frame position+velocity **read-back** (a CPU↔GPU sync that stalls the
  pipeline). For this app's body counts (`MAX_BODIES = 14`) the velocity-Verlet CPU
  integrator is exact *and* faster, so **GPU physics stays a manual opt-in** — it's a
  scaling foundation for hundreds of bodies, not a win for a handful (revisit if a
  "swarm" mode raises the cap; see [future-improvements](./future-improvements.md)).
- Removed a per-frame allocation in `updateBodyUniforms`; reused the read-back
  `Vector3` temps. The raymarch worst-case bounds (`MAX_STEPS`, `volSamples` cap) are
  left as-is — most rays early-out, and lowering them risked photon-ring banding.

## Stability / scene (video findings, v0.14.4–v0.14.6)

- **All-black-screen blowup (fixed v0.14.5).** A non-finite body position propagated
  into the raymarch and blacked out the whole frame. Fixed with defensive guards so a
  non-finite body can never reach the uniforms; the integrator blowup itself is
  guarded at the source too.
- **"Adding a body dropped the count" (fixed v0.14.6).** A seeding/prune race.
- **Crowded multi-hole ejection is real physics, not a bug** — close encounters
  slingshot bodies out (verified against energy/momentum). The ± steppers de-bounce
  adds to avoid manufacturing those pile-ups by accident.
- **Camera ↔ gravity "wobble" is an input artifact**, not the simulation — the camera
  is OrbitControls + damping with no physical coupling. Noted as a possible *opt-in*
  feature (sample the lensing potential to nudge the camera) rather than a defect.

## Intro reality (v0.16.5 transcription)

Superseded by [`intro-script.md`](./intro-script.md) (the master beat table + tuning
log). The honest notes from that snapshot — mobile "splash never plays" (first-paint
gating), the black void at the splash→engine cut, and fresh-load shader-compile
stutter — all shipped (v0.17–0.17.1), and fresh-load smoothness improved again in
v0.20.2 by deferring the engine bundle under the splash.
