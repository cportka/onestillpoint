# Changelog

All notable changes to One Still Point, newest first. Dev notes and deep dives
live in [`docs/`](docs/) (intro script, recording findings, perf audits).

## 0.16.x — spaghettification, binary-merger splash, controls

- **0.16.3** — Splash: the dust is now **small, mostly-warm and lightly
  saturated** (was clownish rainbow) and **spirals** coherently in and back out;
  the canvas is capped-resolution with smaller sprites, so it's much **smoother**.
  **Replay intro** now replays the load splash too. Removing a body **spirals**
  into the centre instead of falling straight in. **Step** → **Step forward**. The
  **FPS** readout fades + pulses in/out so it's easy to spot.
- **0.16.2** — Fixed the two orbs briefly flying apart mid-inspiral on
  Safari/WebKit (keyframes now rotate < 180°/step, so every browser takes the same
  arc). Dust moved to a canvas particle field; render pipeline **pre-warmed** under
  the splash to cut the reveal hitch. **FPS** readout trimmed to just the number.
  **Pause** colours corrected (red running / green stopped). Background presets
  retuned.
- **0.16.1** — A **colourful binary-merger splash**: two orbs (cool + warm) twirl
  together, then a flash, tilted jet, colour plumes and reverberating shock rings
  burst at the merger before the event horizon settles. **Pause** shows state by
  colour; each **Background** loads its own look preset on selection.
- **0.16.0** (Phase 16) — **Spaghettification**: an absorbed body is tidally
  stretched along the line to the hole and thinned across it (a prolate ellipsoid
  in the raymarch — `segmentHitsStretched`), then redshifts and fades. **Pause** is
  a real toggle button; a new **Advanced → Background** folder post-processes the
  selected sky (Brightness · Saturation · Tint). **Lattice** re-tinted greener.

## 0.15.x — performance pass + instant load splash

- **0.15.1** — Splash sized in `vmin` so the forming horizon lines up with the
  real shadow; varied body/dust sizes. About logo full-width then moved below the
  byline. GPU auto-switch investigated and documented
  ([`docs/perf-audit-v0.15.md`](docs/perf-audit-v0.15.md)): not worth it below
  ~150–300 bodies, so it stays a manual toggle.
- **0.15.0** (Phase 15) — **N-body sim back on the CPU by default** (the GPU
  compute path's per-frame read-back stalled the pipeline for ≤14 bodies); removed
  a per-frame allocation in the render loop. A **load splash** paints before the
  WebGPU shader compiles and crossfades into the scene, which now ignites fast.
  **Step** also works while running (~1 s jump); add de-bounce; full-width About
  logo.

## 0.14.x — backgrounds, orbits & absorption

- **0.14.6** — Adding bodies is solid again: the GPU integrator now reads
  **velocities** back (not just positions), so an add no longer re-seeds bodies
  onto wrong orbits; a readback↔rebuild race is closed; substep size is bounded.
  Animated **About logo**; deeper-orange Nebula. See
  [`docs/video-findings-v0.14.5.md`](docs/video-findings-v0.14.5.md).
- **0.14.5** — Adds rate-limited to 1/s; removing a body **plunges** it into the
  centre with the absorption fade. Fixed an **all-black-screen** bug (a non-finite
  body position poisoning the lensing uniforms, never pruned) — see
  [`docs/video-findings-v0.14.4.md`](docs/video-findings-v0.14.4.md). Longer ✓/✗
  flash; Nebula reverted to its punchy orange.
- **0.14.4** — A 4th black hole only when nothing else orbits; added bodies last
  longer (exact radius + softened circular speed); absorbed bodies fade rather than
  pop (groundwork for collision animations). Richer dark-orange Nebula.
- **0.14.3** — Intro performance: geodesic escapes at the scene radius; DPR capped
  ≤ 1.5; cleaner Nebula ramp; About tagline frames the dialog.
- **0.14.2** — More background contrast; ± buttons disable at caps; added holes
  spread onto separated orbits; Replay re-seeds on fresh orbits.
- **0.14.1** — Nebula re-tuned for punch; About gains a BTC donation + the shared
  tagline; escaped/merged companions are pruned (and GPU buffers disposed).
- **0.14.0** (Phase 14) — Background revamp: Eagle-palette **Nebula**, cosmic-web
  **Filaments**, finer **Lattice**. Intro *reality* doc
  ([`docs/intro-description.md`](docs/intro-description.md)) beside the *ideal*
  ([`docs/intro-script.md`](docs/intro-script.md)).

## 0.5–0.13 — foundations

- **0.13** — Selectable **Background** dropdown (all lensed); first video-driven
  intro tuning (default scene seeds 3 stars + 3 planets, earlier entrance); Portka
  Tools `video-bug-analyzer` wired in.
- **0.12** — Bodies **− N + steppers** with a black-hole budget (`bodyCap`);
  **About** modal; panel reorg.
- **0.11** — Each added black hole gets its **own compact accretion disk**
  (`secondaryDisk.ts`); frame-rate-targeted auto-resolution; panel polish.
- **0.10** — UX polish (panel reorder, flush-right, opaque tooltip); reduced-motion
  intro hardening for mobile.
- **0.9** — Performance auto-tuning (quality tiers); cheaper companion lensing
  (weak-field deflection shared across RK4 stages); panel restyle.
- **0.8** — Choreographed entrance (retrograde planets swoosh in after the stars);
  panel reorg (Filter / Advanced settings); secondary-hole render fix.
- **0.7** — Formation sequence: camera dolly + disk **ignition**, skip/replay,
  reduced-motion aware; long-press tooltips; slow-motion Speed.
- **0.6** — **Time acceleration** with representation crossfade (you can't
  brute-force sub-second dynamics at huge scales, so the representation crossfades).
- **0.5** — **Gravitational body simulator**: N-body `PhysicsEngine` (CPU
  velocity-Verlet), companions raymarched inside the curved spacetime so they lens
  and occlude for free. `0.5.1–0.5.3`: tests + CI; weak-field lensing of secondary
  masses; opt-in WebGPU compute N-body kernel; hover tooltips.
- **0.0–0.4** — Scaffold (renderer + WebGL2 fallback + fullscreen TSL pass) →
  Schwarzschild geometry (photon geodesics, shadow, photon ring, lensed starfield)
  → static accretion disk (Shakura–Sunyaev → blackbody, Doppler, redshift) →
  animated volumetric dust → look UI + bloom/tone-map + adaptive resolution.
